# Handel-Noise-Removal
Matlab code to demonstrate the effects of aliasing on signals, and to remove noise from a noisy clip of Handel’s Hallelujah chorus.  

## Part A: Anti-Aliasing 
* Graphs the audio signal as a function of time, and creates a continuous time variable that is correctly scaled for this purpose.
* Computes and graphs the frequency spectrum of the signal.
Also creates an appropriate frequency variable to display frequencies in Hertz, and uses it in graphing the spectrum of the signal.
* Downsamples the audio signal in vector “y” using a downsampling rate of D = 2 & D = 4 with and without an anti-aliasing filter. Then plays back the resulting signal.
 

## Part B: Noise Removal

* Uses three digital filters to remove three artificial
tunes mixed with the Handel signal. Plays the filtered signal afterwards.
